                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On behalf of the entire Toronto Model United Nations (TMUN) secretariat team, it is my honor to invite you to attend TMUN 2024 in-person from March 22-24, 2024 at the Sheraton Centre Toronto Hotel.
                    <br><br>

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is Edward Liu and I will be serving as your Secretary-General for this year's iteration of Toronto Model United Nations, Toronto's only overnight Model UN conference. Throughout the whole conference, I will lead a team of passionate and hard-working high-school students in managing Toronto’s premier Model UN conference to the best of our abilities. <br><br>

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am proud to announce that this year, TMUN will be offering all delegates and chaperones the option of staying overnight at the Sheraton Centre Toronto Hotel. COVID-19 has hit Model UN conferences hard, with many being forced to either go virtual, or to cancel their conferences altogether. I hope that with this year’s iteration of Toronto Model United Nations, we can help to bring back in-person Model UN experiences to Toronto for good.<br><br>

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year, TMUN will feature a wide variety of fun and interesting committees, from the traditional beginner-friendly Disarmament and International Security Committee to the new and innovative Mars Crisis Committee. Delegates will be able to choose their preferred committees during the registration process, and I know that every delegate who registers will be able to find a committee that interests them.<br><br>

                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Model UN has been an incredibly impactful part of my life, and I would not be where I am today if I had never participated in it. I hope that Model UN will have the same effect on all delegates attending TMUN 2024, be it by making a new friend or by becoming a more confident person. Myself and the rest of the Secretariat Team are committed to providing a fun and educational Model United Nations experience to all delegates at TMUN 2024, and we cannot wait to meet everyone in Toronto this March.

                    <br><br>

                    Sincerely,<br>
                </p>

                <p><b>Edward Liu</b><br>
                    Secretary-General<br>
                    Toronto Model United Nations 2024
                </p>
