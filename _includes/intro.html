                <p>
                    Dear esteemed delegates and advisors,
                    <br><br>

                    The Toronto Model United Nations (TMUN) secretariat team welcomes you to attend TMUN 2025 at the Sheraton Centre Hotel Toronto from March 21-23, 2025.
                    <br><br>

                    This iteration, TMUN is proud to feature 4 traditional General Assembly committees for those passionate about world issues, as well as 6 FIctional Crises and 7 Historical Crises for those who seek immersion in an updated, real-time environment. TMUN’s wide variety of committee options is designed so that any delegate who wishes to participate will find something that interests them. 
                    <br><br>

                    At the heart of TMUN is the spirit of collaboration and growth. Whether you're forming political blocs, tackling global challenges or improvising in crisis simulations, TMUN is the perfect place to sharpen your debating, writing, diplomacy, and much more. Every debate, and every negotiation helps build not just a model diplomat, but a citizen for the world.
                    <br><br>

                    The idea of TMUN was first formed during the summer of 2022, after the realization that Toronto had no overnight hotel conferences. And thus, after taking inspiration from other non-profit high-school run conferences around the world, TMUN 2023 became the first MUN conference in Toronto to offer an overnight hotel option, international attention, and run by a team of passionate high-schoolers.
                    <br><br>

                    A team of over 75 dedicated students have been working tirelessly behind the scenes to ensure that this year’s iteration runs as smoothly as possible. When you leave, their hope is that you have made both new friendships and memories that will last for years to come.
                    <br><br>

                    The team looks forward to welcoming you to the conference in March 2025. If any questions or concerns arise, please do not hesitate to contact us at delegateaffairs@tmun.ca. 
                    <br><br>

                    Sincerely,<br> 
                </p>

                <p><b>The TMUN 2025 Secretariat Team</b><br>
                    Toronto Model United Nations 2025
