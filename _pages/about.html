            Toronto Model United Nations (TMUN) is a new annual three-day high-school level Model United Nations conference held downtown Toronto, attracting hundreds of high school students from around the world. With international ambassadors from Kuwait to Vietnam, this year's first iteration of the TMUN will be a truly international Model United Nations experience.
            <br><br>
            Model UN is an educational simulation of the real United Nations in which high school students represent delegates of different countries in varying international bodies. From the United Nations Security Council to the World Health Organization, delegates will be able to debate real world topics on the international stage in committees modern, historical and fictional.
            <br><br>
            Attending TMUN is a great opportunity for high school students to develop their public speaking, self-confidence, and intrapersonal skills. During committee sessions, delegates will participate in engaging debate and diplomacy while coming up with new and innovative solutions to some of the world's most pressing issues.
            <br><br>
            Through our exciting committees, experienced staff team and excellent quality of debate, we hope to help foster the next generation of global leaders. This year, we are happy to announce that TMUN 2023 will be held in-person at Sheraton Centre Toronto Hotel, with the option for delegates to stay overnight at the hotel.
            <br><br>
            The secretariat team of this year's iteration of TMUN cannot wait to welcome all delegates, teachers, and chaperones to the wonderful city of Toronto this upcoming March.
