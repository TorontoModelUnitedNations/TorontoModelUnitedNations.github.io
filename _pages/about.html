            TMUN is a new annual three-day high-school level Model UN conference held in downtown Toronto. It will be held at the Sheraton Centre Toronto Hotel from March 24-26.
            <br><br>
            Our conference is student-led, and we aim to allow youth to experience the feeling of being a real UN delegate for three days.
            <br><br>
            Delegates will be able to debate real world issues on the international stage in committees modern, historical and fictional. We aim to raise awareness about global issues and get the next generation interested in solving these issues in innovative ways as well as facilitating discussion on them.
            <br><br>
            During our conference, delegates will draft resolutions with solutions to these problems, and will be able to share and discuss ideas in a formal debate setting with other participants.
            <br><br>
            For many, Model UN becomes an integral part of their highschool career, and our goal is to bring that to Toronto in the most accessible and engaging way possible.
