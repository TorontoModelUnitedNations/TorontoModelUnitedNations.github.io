  <p>
    TMUN is committed to providing financial aid to any delegate who is unable to attend due to financial concerns. We aim to be able to provide generous financial aid to delegates on a need-based basis, and we believe that no delegate should be unable to participate because of financial reasons.<br><br>

    If you believe that you need any financial aid whatsoever, please feel free to apply through our form - which will be released shortly.
