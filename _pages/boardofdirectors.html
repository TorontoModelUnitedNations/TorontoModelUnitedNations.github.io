The Board of Directors helps to ensure the long-term continuity of the Toronto Model United Nations conference, and uses their experience to assist the TMUN Secretariat Team. The TMUN Board of Directors will be present during the conference as well as any other TMUN-affiliated events to assist in any emergency situations.
