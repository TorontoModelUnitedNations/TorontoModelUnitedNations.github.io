  description: Hello delegates, my name is Jacob Greene. I am a grade 10 student and I will be your Undersecretary-General of Committees for the first iteration of Toronto Model United Nations. I have always had a passion for learning history, geography and world politics, and stepping into the world of MUN over three years ago has allowed me to pursue this passion even further. I sincerely hope that delegates have a fun and memorable experience during our conference, and I wish the best of luck to all delegates partaking in TMUN 2024!
