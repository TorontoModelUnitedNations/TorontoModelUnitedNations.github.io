- title: Conference Format
  info: "TMUN 2024 will be held in a hybrid format. Delegates will have the option to register either in-person or online, and both online and in-person delegates will follow the same schedule, and will both have access to all conference events. However, instead of an in-person delegate social, online delegates will be able to participate in an online social."
- title: Independent Delegates
  info: "Delegates attending the conference independently do not have to fill out the delegation/group registration form, and are only required to fill out the delegate registration form. Independent delegates will have access to the same conference events as delegation/groups, and will not face any barriers if they do choose to attend independently."
- title: Delegation/Group Registration
  info: "If a group of delegates wishes to attend the conference as a delegation/group, they must fill out the delegation/group Registration Form above. A delegation/group can be anything from an official high school Model UN club to a few friends wishing to attend TMUN as a group. It is not necessary to have a delegation/group in order to attend TMUN 2024, and you are able to attend as an Independent Delegate if you are not attending as a delegation/group.
         <br><br>
         <b>It is not necessary</b> to have a delegation/group in order to attend TMUN 2024, and you are able to attend as an Independent Delegate if you are not attending as a delegation/group.
         <br><br>
         To register as a delegation/group, have your head delegate/adult chaperone fill out the <a href='https://form.jotform.com/221755677214056'>delegation/group registration form</a>. <br>
         Your head delegate or adult chaperone will then be emailed a custom registration form for your group/school <br>

         Online delegations must register using the same process."
- title: Day Delegates
  info: "Instead of registering as a regular delegate, attendees have the option of registering as Day Delegates. Day Delegates are able to attend all conference events including the delegate social, however they do not stay at the Sheraton Centre Toronto Hotel overnight. The cost of attending as a Day Delegate is lower to reflect the removal of an overnight hotel stay."
- title: Chaperone Policy
  info: "Delegation/groups attending TMUN 2024 do not need to be accompanied by a chaperone. If a chaperone or multiple chaperones do decide to attend with a delegation/group, they will be able to indicate so on the registration form.
         <br><br>
         If you are an independent delegate but have chaperone(s) coming with you, please email <a href=mailto:delegateaffairs@tmun.ca target='_blank'>delegateaffairs@tmun.ca</a>"
- title: Rooming Policy
  info: "All delegates who purchase regular registration will be given a two nights stay at the Sheraton Centre Toronto Hotel. delegation/groups will be able to access a form through which they will be able to manage the rooming of their own delegates, while the rooming of independent delegates will be managed by TMUN.
         <br><br>
         If delegates wish to room with specific delegates who arenâ€™t members of their delegation/group, they have the option to do so. (e.g. independents rooming together, members of a delegation/group rooming with independents)
         <br><br>
         We understand that many delegates may want to stay for extra nights at the hotel either before or after the conference. If you or your delegation/group is interested in doing so, please feel free to contact us at <a href=mailto:delegateaffairs@tmun.ca target='_blank'>delegateaffairs@tmun.ca</a>. Different members of a delegation/group do not have to arrive or leave on the same date."
