  info: TMUN 2023 will run in a hybrid format, with eight exciting in-person committees and two online
         committees. With offerings ranging from the classic Disarmament and International Security Committee to the new and innovative Mars Crisis Committee, there is a committee for everyone.
         
         During the registration process, delegates will be able to indicate the top three committees that they would like to participate in.

    description: "DISEC or the Disarmament and International Security Committee is a prominent General Assembly committee addressing issues and deterrents to achieving a global peace.  Topics that are often discussed relate to weapons, disarmament, and the safety of those affected by armed conflict. Dealing with not only global threats to peace, this important committee discusses solutions through international cooperation to achieve the principles in governing disarmament and agenda goals. Delegates will represent nations partaking in the DISEC committee to address the topics introduced for the session. This committee is fundamental in preserving a state of peace between great powers, and enforcing law and stability on an extensive scale."

    topics:
      - title: "Topic A - Global Illicit Arms Trading"
        desc: "Throughout human history and that since the existence of warfare, the supply of weapons has been a cornerstone in the success of a campaign. In more recent times, illegal and clandestine dealings of weapons has proven to become more prevalent in conflicts, when belligerents are unable to financially support official arms purchases. This has resulted in the circulation of weapons throughout the developing and war-torn areas of the world, falling into the hands of civilians and militant groups. DISEC and the United Nations strive to resolve or find a way to civilly manage the issue of illegitimate weapon circulation and mitigate the negative effects it has on the citizens of the world."
      - title: "Topic B - Nuclear Weapons on the Global Stage"
        desc: "Since the development and introduction of nuclear weapons, the world has witnessed the suffering and pain they have the potential to cause upon a nation and its populace. Nagasaki and Hiroshima were the first - and thus far - only atomic weapons used in an armed conflict. These two humanitarian disasters were caused by the primitive ancestors of these weapons we possess today. Bombs that could inflict immediate damage one hundred times more than that of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, on humans but also the environment. In this day and age, the United Nations and DISEC must consider the counterintuitive impacts that the continued testing and possible strategic usage of nuclear weapons in warfare could mean for the future of our world, and in conflicts such as climate change, and the war in Ukraine."

    description: "Established in 1947, the United Nations General Assembly Sixth Committee, also known as the Legal committee, is a primary forum that focuses on the development of international law and other legal matters concerning the United Nations. Annually, the Legal committee circulates around 5 main topic areas, namely the promotion of justice and international law, accountability and internal United Nations justice matters, Drug control, Crime prevention, and Combating international terrorism. However, here in the Legal committee, delegates will debate on the wide variety of global matters from the perspective of their legitimacy with great focus on established international law and national sovereignty. At TMUN 2022, delegates of the Legal committee will not only engage in 3 days of civilized debate, but also receive insightful takeaways on the United Nations Legal conventions to last. This committee holds great expectations of offering a collaborative and educational environment for all, and hopes to witness creative and original solutions that address the agenda topics."

    topics:
      - title: "Topic A - Transitional Justice"
        desc: "History is composed of various cases of serious human right violations, inclusive of state sanctioned tragedies. Political rhetoric centers on methods to end such cases, however guidelines for nations to rebuild afterwards is also of utmost importance. Thus transitional justice comes to play, as the process to which nations utilize to address these tragedies. It asks some of the most difficult questions in law, politics, and the social sciences and grapples with innumerable dilemmas. Above all, transitional justice is about victims, how to address the legacies of horrendous atrocities, or to end recurring cycles of violent conflict, by developing a range of responses covering 3 areas; truth-seeking, victim reparations, and prosecutions."
      - title: "Topic B - Regulating Multinational Corporations"
        desc: "Multinational corporations (MNCs) are large businesses operating in numerous countries. Because they operate in different legal jurisdictions, MNCs can be difficult for any one government to regulate. Since MNCs are working in the foreign country (host country), it is necessary that they must not violate and abuse human rights or break legal laws of the host country. Sometimes these MNCs take advantage of its strength and try to dominate in the host country, compelling the government to change their laws favoring MNCs. For this topic, delegates will consider the legal solutions that the UN could pursue to hold these MNCs accountable. Only through systems of accountability and responsibility can MNCs become purely beneficial contributors to global prosperity."

Initially created as an emergency response to the dire situation that World War II left children in across the globe, the organization began to work towards combating famine and disease in the youth population. Not long after, The United Nations then extended UNICEF's mandate, thereby establishing it as a committee dedicated to the advocation and protection of the wellbeing of children. Today, the committee's goal is to strive towards overcoming poverty, disease, and exploitation, as well as providing aid for the education, health, and welfare of children."

    topics:
      - title: "Topic A - Recruitment of Children in Armed Militias"
        desc: "The recruitment of children into armed forces is a violation of international humanitarian law. Throughout history, thousands of children have been recruited for the purpose of aiding armed forces in conflicts across the world. Child soldiers are abducted and then exploited for the purposes of engaging in combat for local militia, facing appalling violence in their formative years. Consequently, these children experience poverty, disability, death, and ostracization in their own communities. Those who are able to escape or are dismissed from service deal with insurmountable psychological afflictions and an inability to effectively rejoin society. Today, UNICEF aims to dissolve the recruitment of child soldiers in warring countries and work towards rehabilitating child victims of such violence."
      - title: "Topic B - Child Trafficking in Asia-Pacific"
        desc: "Asia has long been a major transgressing region in terms of their significant numbers of child trafficking cases. Abduction, luring, and deception are used to draw in many children into abusive and cruel industries that generate billions of dollars in profit annually. Considered a high-value commodity, millions of children are forced into prostitution rings and slave labour with them making up one third of all trafficking victims worldwide. They experience sexual abuse, forced labour, organ trafficking, and slavery in one of the largest, most lucrative crime industries in the world. Providing pathways and strengthening child protection policies are key goals in UNICEF's active involvement."

In SOCHUM TMUN 2023, we will be discussing Human Trafficking in South East Asia, and the Treatment of LGBTQI+ People in Africa. These topics, while centred around a geographical area for the sake of debate, are complex global issues, that require cooperative and creative solutions."

        desc: "Hateful acts towards LGBTQI+ people continue to occur daily around the world. A shockingly low 14% of people said that homosexuality should be accepted in a study done in 2019, this is highlighted especially in Africa, and the rest of the world. Sadly, LGBTQI+ peoples frequently report acts of violence against them in their homes, places of work and worship, in countries such as Kenya, Georgia, Honduras, Cameroon, etc. These people are often ignored by their governments and police forces when they ask for help or go to report hate crimes, and in many cases, the people in power are the abusers."
      - title: "Topic B - Human Trafficking in South East Asia"
        desc: "Although many people view slavery as a dark piece of history, it continues to thrive today in the form of human trafficking - defined as the act of transporting an individual by coercion, force, or manipulation to benefit from them typically in the form of sexual exploitation, forced labour, and organ extraction. The United Nations has estimated that this illegal activity generates approximately $32 billion USD annually for offenders making it the second most profitable criminal enterprise after drug trafficking. Organizations engaged in human trafficking are highly structured, with established clandestine transnational routes, and are equipped with action plans to carry out each stage of the crime."

      description: "What began with an upset produce vendor in Tunisia who lit himself on fire to protest the corrupt regime under Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, would later lead to one of the most significant revolutions in human history. With a total of 6 governments overthrown, multiple civil wars, and 20 countries directly affected, some resulted in the original goal of achieving freedom, liberty, human rights, and democracy but the majority resulted in ongoing civil wars and increased tyranny from the government. This is due to the various actors with varying points of view from the corrupt governments, to the protesters, to extremist organizations, to external Western nations choosing sides. This crisis committee took place on January 14th, 2011, the end of the overthrow of the Tunisia government and the beginning of the protests in the Arab world. Your task as delegates representing various actors is to achieve your agenda - whatever agenda that may be."

However, with protests arising many nations are in the direction of civil war, destruction, and unnecessary mass bloodshed. The goal of this topic is to reduce the overall damage of the revolutions and to maximize its chances of creating a democratic nation."

          desc: "Over the years, people have searched for alternatives to ensure the survival of the human race as pollution hugely impacts our health and our current planet in a non-reversible way. This severe pollution causes extreme weather events that occur frequently in the 2040s. Missions and studies that have been carried out on Mars in the 2020s as well as the calculations of scientists suggest that Mars colonization is the most reliable and realistic way to ensure the prosperity of humankind. Delegates will have to come up with a relatively detailed and concrete plan of an efficient voyage from Earth to Mars while taking into consideration the limited time and resources that are left on Earth, keeping in mind that negotiation between governments, corporations, and the population as a whole is also important. "
        - title: "Topic B – Rebuilding Foundations"
          desc: "The colonization of Mars also consists of settling on the red planet. To start rebuilding the daily routines that are similar to the ones on Earth, delegates will have to write directives regarding the land distribution, transportation, as well as construction of infrastructure and basic public services such as health and education systems on Mars. While trying to build foundations on Mars, delegates should also bear in mind that continuous communication with Earth is also important. This includes sharing resources, keeping in touch with people who are still on Earth, potentially bringing more people to Mars during the first few years of colonization, etc."

Will you be able to come out on top? Or will you fall to the wrath of modern geopolitics and conflict? Whatever happens, may the best delegate win."

        - title: "Topic A - Sanctions & the Economic State of the World"
          desc: "Since the beginning of the 2022 Russo-Ukrainian conflict, sanctions have rained down on Russia from almost every corner. The economic state of the world has arguably never been more volatile since WW2. With almost all of Europe, the United States, Canada and so many others laying massive economic sanctions on the nation, and with Russia also being kicked out of many economic, sporting, & political organizations, it goes to wonder how much either side can keep this up. Whether it be reduced oil & gas supply and the subsequent price hikes, or major companies leaving and almost blacklisting nations, something must be done. The economic situation can only remain so tense for so long before one side must cave in, and it is up to delegates to now write the script and make sure it is not their nations who succumb to the pressures first."
        - title: "Topic B - Separatist Regions & Political Control"
          desc: "With the public announcement of the “special military operation” in Ukraine came the official claims to independence from two self-proclaimed nations: the Luhansk & Donetsk Peoples’ Republics. Recognized by the Russian government, and even holding referendums regarding integration into the Russian state, the sovereignty and ownership of two separatist nations pose a grave challenge to all. Combined with the ever-lasting problem of Crimea, the issue of Ukraine’s Russian-backed seperatist regions and political control over the region as a whole must remain at the forefront of any debate regarding the conflict."

      description: "The World Health Organization targets all issues related to the topic of global health, which may be intertwined with global politics. Healthcare inequalities continue to worsen, especially between low and high income communities, with large discrepancies in both quality and quantity of care. The COVID-19 pandemic caused a global health crisis, a crisis which can be avoided in the future if countries choose to be prepared. Both issues come with long and diverse backgrounds of information. But if one thing is for sure, these are prominent issues that must be addressed imminently."

New industries and frontiers also open up new legal challenges and delegates must ensure their countries' concerns are heard when writing resolutions. Discussions can range from new space travel regulations in response to the moon base planned in the USA's Artemis moon mission, the impact of AI and automation around the world, and the movement of rare earth metals for green technologies. Delegates must cooperate to come to agreements to make sure their country is at the edge of innovation."

      topics:
        - title: Internal Stability
          desc: "Since the establishment of the People’s Republic of China, internal stability has become a struggle to maintain. Increasing separatist movements in regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet coupled with the factionalism within the Red Guards is causing a treacherous increase in unrest. The People’s Republic, founded not long ago, faces more internal strife as separatist groups and Kuomintang remnants continue to cause unrest. Chairman Mao Zedong created the Red Guards to counter these revisionist forces; however, Mao’s efforts are beginning to backfire as factions begin to form in the Red Guards, additionally disbanding the cause. Given further provocation from Vietnamese and Soviet borders, it is up to delegates to stabilize the growing PRC’s internal situation and expand the nation’s influence."
        - title: Economic Stagnation and Recovery from the Great Leap Forward
          desc: "Due to the damages to the PRC from the Second Sino-Japanese war and the Chinese Civil War, the Chinese economy is in a recession. Many skilled young men have died fighting the Japanese. Due to the lack of skilled individuals, the rebuilding of the Chinese economy and industries are stagnant. After many pecuniary policies, Chinese industry is still weaker than what it can be. Activities from revisionist groups and the costs of repressing them is costing our industry as Red Guards use cargo transportation to instead transport their ranks to suppress revisionists. This, amongst many other problems, are what delegates need to resolve in order to set China on the correct path to prosperity."
