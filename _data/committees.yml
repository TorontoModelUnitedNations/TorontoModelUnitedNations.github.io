  info: TMUN 2023 will run in a hybrid format, with eight exciting in-person committees and two online
         committees. With offerings ranging from the classic Disarmament and International Security Committee to the new and innovative Mars Crisis Committee, there is a committee for everyone.
         
         During the registration process, delegates will be able to indicate the top three committees that they would like to participate in. While we cannot guarantee that delegates will be placed in their preferred committees, it is more likely that you will receive your preferred committee if you register earlier.

    topics:
      - title: "TOPIC A - Issues Surrounding Decolonization"
        desc: "As the age of colonialism is behind us, decolonization was and is the next step for any state that has not reached self-governance or integration with another state. As such, this can cause many issues, such as political disputes, territorial disputes, socio economic issues, and most importantly of all, affecting the livelihood of its people. The world is still very much in a grey area when it comes to decolonization, and many places’ futures are still indeterminate to this day. It is important that we come together and finally make sense of how we can properly decolonize the world and lead everyone to peace and prosperity. "
      - title: "Topic B - Refugees of the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict"
        desc: "The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been an ongoing conflict since the mid-20th century, and has affected the lives of millions. As a result of violence and dispute, many people from the region have seen themselves displaced, living in refugee camps, where poverty is at an all time high and basic infrastructure is missing. With seemingly no conclusion to this conflict, it is imperative that the peoples’ needs are being met, in order for them to lead as healthy and prosperous lives as possible. It is important that we are able to provide the best solutions we can for these refugees, who have suffered for decades due to this issue."

      - title: "Topic B - Mining Practices in the Arctic"
        desc: "The UNHRC will also turn its attention to the complex issue of mining practices in the Arctic region.

    topics:
      - title: "Topic A - Mediterranean Migrant Crisis"
        desc: "The Mediterranean route is one of the popular routes used by migrants attempting to reach Europe. Migrants, typically embarking from North Africa, cross dangerous waters in hopes of landing on the shores of countries such as Spain, Italy, or Greece. These countries are often reluctant to take responsibility for any rescue and processing of migrants, and, oftentimes, the overcrowded and unsafe boats sink at sea. According to the UN, over 26,000 people have died at sea in the Mediterranean in the past decade. "
      - title: "Topic B - Governments and Social Media"
        desc: "Social media has revolutionized the manner in which information is created and shared, with far-reaching implications for governments and their citizens. From fuelling revolutions during the Arab Spring of 2011, to spreading alternative pandemic treatments and cures, the influence of social media can seriously threaten government authority and public order. On the other hand, social media has allowed billions of people to participate in democratic discourse and marginalized groups and causes to coalesce. Another concern is the vast amount of data collected by private companies and the threat to user privacy."

    topics:
      - title: "Topic A - CBRN Warfare"
        desc: "In the realm of warfare and conflict, the specter of bioweapons and chemical weapons looms ominously, underscoring the depths to which human ingenuity can descend when harnessed for destructive purposes. These two categories of unconventional weaponry, while distinct in nature, share a common thread of utilizing toxic agents to inflict harm upon adversaries. Bioweapons harness living organisms or their byproducts to unleash diseases, while chemical weapons leverage synthetic compounds to cause incapacitation or death. As the global community grapples with the evolving landscape of warfare and security threats, the responsibilities of DISEC expand beyond mere discussions to fostering tangible actions. The urgency of the situation demands that DISEC members collaborate to formulate concrete strategies that not only prevent the further spread of these devastating tools but also hold accountable those who seek to employ them. "
      - title: "Topic B - The Korean Peninsula"
        desc: "In the complex geopolitical landscape of the Korean Peninsula, the specter of nuclear mobilization has cast a shadow over regional stability and global security. The interplay of historical, political, and military dynamics has led to a situation where the presence and potential use of nuclear weaponry has become central to discussions and concerns surrounding this region. The intricate web of interests and tensions has elevated the urgency of comprehending the factors that have contributed to the nuclear mobilization in the Korean Peninsula. As one of the main committees of the United Nations General Assembly, DISEC plays a vital role in deliberating on strategies to mitigate tensions, promote disarmament, and secure a peaceful resolution to the ongoing crisis. The committee's historical significance, rooted in its establishment as a fundamental component of the UN in 1945, reflects the global acknowledgment of the imperative to prevent the escalation of nuclear tensions and promote lasting security measures."
