      topics:
        - title: "Topic A - Cryptocurrencies"
          desc: "After the Great Recession of 2008, the infamous cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, came into existence to provide individuals with a decentralized currency. This was created to be a tool to protect people’s finances, and privacy, by removing the control of governments and banks; thus the concept that led to the birth of thousands of other cryptocurrencies since then. Unfortunately, the pseudonymous nature of cryptocurrencies, a component intended to protect privacy, has also been exploited by criminals. Issues like money laundering, sanction evasion, and embezzlement have started to plague the world as a result. On a positive note, cryptocurrencies are also being used as a tool for developing nations to improve their economies. For this topic, delegates must understand the mechanics of cryptocurrencies to develop comprehensive approaches to address various unlawful activities associated with them. At the same time, delegates must also recognize the potential benefits of these currencies for the greater good."
        - title: "Topic B - The Darknet"
          desc: "The dark web is notoriously known as a hidden section of the internet, often associated with illicit activities and online black markets. However, despite its reputation, the dark web’s original purpose, and the majority of its use today, is not illegal. Dark web browsers, such as Tor, were introduced to the world to provide people with safer, and more secure internet use. Today, it is being used in oppressive regimes by whistleblowers, activists, and journalists to seek freedom and help. That being said, cybercriminals do take advantage of the anonymity of the darknet to participate in illegal activities such as drug trafficking, arms trading, and intellectual property infringement. Taking this information into account, and considering the fact that dark web browsers are legal in most countries, delegates will take their respective nation’s stance on how to apprehend and prevent these criminals, while acknowledging the dark web’s uses; balancing its necessity with the need to mitigate harm."

        - title: "Topic A - Mandating vaccination for children"
          desc: "As accessible international mobility continues to strengthen, viruses and diseases spread at revolutionary rates. The UNICEF committee will especially focus on maintaining the balance of public health and individual rights within child welfare. As an advocate for children on the world stage, it is up to delegates to determine the proper proactive response with regard to parental/individual rights, financial strain on nations, ethical implementation, as well as many other morally ambiguous factors playing into this issue."
        - title: "Topic B - Child Labour and Exploitation"
          desc: "With the popularity of fast fashion and large companies expanding globally, child labour and exploitation become a hard issue for many to ignore. While it may seem simple to point out that child labour is a horrific problem that plagues many families and nations, especially developing nations, finding a solution is far more complex. This is because child labour and exploitation is a multifaceted issue with deep-rooted causes. Additionally, many countries and companies worldwide rely on the exploitation of these workers to boost their economies, causing this to be a rapidly growing issue worldwide. Ultimately, this is an issue that needs to be tackled from its roots and to not only end it but also prevent it for the future."

          desc: "Voting is one of the basic human rights which can't be denied to every human being, but in a few countries voting rights are denied for a few reasons mainly for Criminal Records. This is implemented in a few countries to prevent criminals from voting for the wrong leader of the country. The same goes for weighted voting systems where an individual's vote will count less the older they get in order to give way to the young individuals to choose the right leader to sustain the current period of time and in the future where the young individuals are the ones going to experience under a government in the long term."
        - title: "Allowing minors the rights of adults according to an individual’s Intelligence Quotient (IQ)"
          desc: "Minors' ages in several countries differ according to each country’s different policies and political backgrounds such as the Minor Consent age in few countries is different from several other countries. In a scenario of a minor with no parents but in that country the minor has not reached the appropriate independent action age, that specific minor would not be able to access basic needs without their parents’ consent such as education, health care, etc. In several countries, minors are asked to consent to medical treatment as the minor knows better what's going on."

Agenda 2063, a comprehensive plan aimed at developing Africa into a global powerhouse, united in peace and prosperity, embodies the core objective of the African Union. The path to accomplishing these ambitious goals is not without its difficulties, though, as member states frequently must find a balance between their own national interests and the aspirations of the continent as a whole.

      topics:
        - title: "Topic A - Combating Political Instability in the Sahel"
          desc: "The Sahel region has become a hotspot for political instability, with countries like Mali, Niger, and Burkina Faso experiencing military coups in recent years. The situation has gotten worse as a result of insurgent organizations like ISIS and al-Qaeda taking advantage of the weaknesses in the area. The stabilizing effects of international military deployments meant to counter these radical threats have not always materialized. Some contend that these interventions strengthen military regimes, weakening democratic governments and creating instability in Africa.
          <br><br>
          Delegates must think about establishing an agreement between local government and military assistance as we examine this issue. While some may believe that military assistance is essential to bringing about stability in the area, others will need to consider whether community-driven peace initiatives, humanitarian aid, and diplomacy can provide better long-term solutions. The primary points of contention will be how to bring the region's government back on track while also addressing the fundamental causes of the insurgencies and making sure that military support doesn't encourage more opportunities for corruption."
        - title: "Topic B - Improving Agenda 2063"
          desc: "The African Union's Agenda 2063, which aims to transform Africa by 2063, embodies the aspirations of the continent as a whole. However, despite achievements like the establishment of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), there have been problems in the execution of important projects. Many member countries remain cautious about certain aspects of the plan, particularly when it comes to reducing economic dependency on external resources and addressing corruption. Some believe that the actions necessary for more sustainable growth and deeper integration could jeopardize current international ties or put national economic stability at risk.
          <br><br>
          This topic will provide an outline for delegates to assess how best to accelerate progress on Agenda 2063 while considering the diverse economic and political realities of African nations. Whether concentrating on technology sharing, governance reforms, or overcoming financial challenges, participants will have to balance the advantages and disadvantages of advancing with the agenda's full execution. How to accomplish Africa's long-term goals without sacrificing the urgent needs of individual countries is the primary topic of discussion."

      <br><br>
      However, that world is faltering, as a new, mysterious disturbance in the Matrix has been taking root. Large breaches of awareness are breaking out, with no clear explanation behind it. Given enough time, this could cause the collapse of the entire system, and the reality of billions of humans along with it. 
      <br><br>
      In this committee, delegates will play the role of Agents, tasked with maintaining order in the Matrix. You will have to investigate this disturbance, and answer the question: Is this just a routine resistance activity, or is this part of a larger conspiracy?"

As long as the human resistance is allowed to continue existing, the Matrix will never truly be secure.

      As NERV officials and stakeholders stationed in the fortress city of Tokyo-3, Delegates must fend off the returning threat of Angels or risk another cataclysm. Navigating this world-ending crisis will take creative battle plans and clever resource management—including the young, volatile Evangelion pilots—all while an “instrumental” conspiracy unfolds in the soul of NERV.

      After a plash crash, a group of miscellaneous characters across dystopias find themselves on an isolated island – liberated from all social order. A retelling of the classic “stranded on a deserted area” cliche, this “Lord of the Flies” committee interrogates what makes us human, and how we act when there are no rules. With all power up for grabs at the start of the committee, each delegate is free to pursue their goals – whether it be a social organization or complete chaos and violence."

Contained anomalies or “SCPs” have Object Classes that indicate how hard they are to contain. There are three main classes, along with a couple of miscellaneous ones which won’t be mentioned. “Safe”, meaning the SCP is easy to contain. A simple box to contain the SCP would be an example of a Safe object class. “Euclid”, meaning the SCP is harder to contain, reasons for the difficulty of containment can be due to our lack of knowledge of the SCP, or just the simple fact that the SCP is a bit feisty. The most dangerous, “Keter”, takes extensive resources and planning to contain, often not containing them correctly due to the lack of understanding of the SCP. Some SCPs are so hard to contain in fact, that the SCP foundation simply can not, and some SCPs simply break containment. These SCPs will be the star of this committee, taking in the form of the topics delegates will need to discuss. In this committee, delegates will take the roles of scientists/various other roles with the highest clearance, allowing freedom to do whatever they so desire."

SCP-354-3 was a black metallic sphere like the Gravitals from C. M. Kosemen’s All Tomorrows. It emitted concentrated beams of radiation capable of crippling anyone and later killing them. SCP-354-3 was neutralized by a sledgehammer, exploding and causing minor damage to the site. SCP-354-6 was a man of Indian descent who emerged from the pool. Due to ongoing repairs going on at the site, the man was shot on sight. DNA tests later revealed that SCP-354-6 was an ordinary man.

What began as a mission by British forces to seize colonial weapon stockpiles quickly escalated into open conflict, as colonial militias, enraged by years of taxation without representation and growing British oppression, stood their ground. The first shots were fired, and what was a growing political dispute erupted into the start of the American Revolutionary War.

    The American colonies now face a pivotal moment: will they unite for independence or reconcile with the British Crown? King George III views the colonies as a threat to his order and has sent forces to crush the resistance, while the Continental Congress debates its next move—diplomacy, war, or full independence. In this committee, you'll step into 1775 as Colonial leaders, navigating alliances, strategy, and key decisions that will shape the American Revolution.

Although much of this territory is not inhabited by ethnic Poles, Polish minorities are scattered throughout the region. Some politicians dream of restoring Poland to its former sized, while others decry this as unrealistic. From its base in Warsaw, the Polish government must decide how much land they wish to claim. Will you abandon your countrymen, or will you risk the entire nation to include them?"
      - title: "Topic B - Shaping Poland’s Government"
        desc: "The old Poland was an elective monarchy dominated by the powerful magnates. This form of government means that the country has no ruling dynasty to return to the country and claim its throne. Already, Joseph Piłsudski, the most powerful man in Poland, has declared Poland to be a republic. However, the form of this republic remains to be established. Some argue that a strongman would best rule Poland. Meanwhile others believe that they should be built on liberal Western principles, such as those of England. Finally, a minority of Poles look east and take inspiration from Lenin’s revolution. On top of this already  confusing situation is the status of the country’s ethnic minorities. In 1919, Eastern Europe is the opposite of ethnically homogeneous. Any Polish state would incorporate large numbers of Ukrainians, Germans, Jews, Lithuanians, etc.  There remain a variety of opinions regarding what privileges and rights these groups should be given. What path will you take in the treacherous political waters of Poland?"

However, today, the company finds itself in an exceedingly different place. Following two fatal crashes of its 737 MAX aircraft killing hundreds, Boeing is under sharp criticism from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, Congress, pilot and airline unions, and its shareholders. As members of the company’s Board of Directors, you are tasked with attempting to pull Boeing out of its current scandal to minimize financial losses and damage to its reputation. If successful, you could restore the confidence that once made Boeing a symbol of safety and glorious innovation in aviation."

Just a few months later, Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, operated by the same aircraft, crashed six minutes after takeoff. Following these two crashes, intense turmoil was sparked on a global scale. Boeing's safety practices and regulatory oversight were consequently put into severe question. You, delegates,  must determine and address the root causes of these crashes as well as their repercussions on the broader airline industry. You must determine which parties are to blame and make instrumental decisions that will forever shape the future of The Boeing Company."

Recent setbacks Boeing has had to face, namely the current scandal have aggressively hindered its ability to compete effectively with Airbus. Capitalizing on these complications, Airbus has seen a notable increase in market share, with bolstered sales of its own aircrafts. To ensure the long-term survival and prosperity of The Boeing Company, delegates must not only address its current scandal but also implement a strategy to effectively counter Airbus’ competitive advances to reclaim Boeing’s position as the leader in the industry."

      description: "Established in 1945, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations leads the global effort to defeat hunger and malnutrition, with a particular focus on food security for all. Being the leading UN organization in agriculture, better nutrition, and rural development, FAO takes center stage in efforts toward resolving food scarcity, environmental degradation, ethical responsibilities, and inequality in food distribution. As a specialized agency, delegates in the FAO will explore sustainable food systems, and work on generating reliable production that delivers efficiency and conservation."

      topics:
        - title: "Topic A - Combating Food Insecurity in Developing Nations"
          desc: "Food insecurity remains a challenge that most developing nations are facing, where millions of people are continuously suffering from hunger and malnutrition problems due to poverty, climate change, conflict, and poor agricultural infrastructure. This topic will try to engage in how international cooperation can solve food insecurity at its root causes. In this case, it will bring about the use of sustainable agricultural methods, equitable distribution of food, and recognition of policies that enhance access to resources, technology, and education. The aim will be the creation of comprehensive solutions that will deliver urgent relief but at the same time build resilience against hunger in the longer term in the most vulnerable regions."
        - title: "Topic B - Improving Ethical Livestock Management Practices"
          desc: "Ethical livestock management is crucial for ensuring animal welfare, sustainability, and economic viability. As global meat production continues to rise, delegates must consider the ethical implications of sustainable agricultural practices. The FAO committee will address several issues within the livestock management industry, including the environmental impacts, inhumane treatment, and challenges within industrialization. While considering the economic value of the current livestock interphase, this topic will delve into the dilemma of whether profitable margins overrule animal welfare. Overall, delegates will address the ethical principles and moral responsibilities in livestock management."
