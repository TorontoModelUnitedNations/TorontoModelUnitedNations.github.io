  info: TMUN 2023 will run in a hybrid format, with eight exciting in-person committees and two online
         committees. With offerings ranging from the classic Disarmament and International Security Committee to the new and innovative Mars Crisis Committee, there is a committee for everyone.
         <br><br>
         During the registration process, delegates will be able to indicate the top three committees that they would like to participate in. While we cannot guarantee that delegates will be placed in their preferred committees, it is more likely that you will receive your preferred committee if you register earlier.

    description: "Established in 1947, the United Nations General Assembly Sixth Committee, also known as the Legal committee, is a primary forum that focuses on the development of international law and other legal matters concerning the United Nations. Annually, the Legal committee circulates around 5 main topic areas, namely the promotion of justice and international law, accountability and internal United Nations justice matters, Drug control, Crime prevention, and Combating international terrorism. However, here in the Legal committee, delegates will debate on the wide variety of global matters from the perspective of their legitimacy with great focus on established international law and national sovereignty. At TMUN 2022, delegates of the Legal committee will not only engage in 3 days of civilized debate, but also receive insightful takeaways on the United Nations Legal conventions to last. This committee holds great expectations of offering a collaborative and educational environment for all, and hopes to witness creative and original solutions that address the agenda topics."

Initially created as an emergency response to the dire situation that World War II left children in across the globe, the organization began to work towards combating famine and disease in the youth population. Not long after, The United Nations then extended UNICEF's mandate, thereby establishing it as a committee dedicated to the advocation and protection of the wellbeing of children. Today, the committee's goal is to strive towards overcoming poverty, disease, and exploitation, as well as providing aid for the education, health, and welfare of children."

      description: "What began with an upset produce vendor in Tunisia who lit himself on fire to protest the corrupt regime under Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, would later lead to one of the most significant revolutions in human history. With a total of 6 governments overthrown, multiple civil wars, and 20 countries directly affected, some resulted in the original goal of achieving freedom, liberty, human rights, and democracy but the majority resulted in ongoing civil wars and increased tyranny from the government. This is due to the various actors with varying points of view from the corrupt governments, to the protesters, to extremist organizations, to external Western nations choosing sides. This crisis committee took place on January 14th, 2011, the end of the overthrow of the Tunisia government and the beginning of the protests in the Arab world. Your task as delegates representing various actors is to achieve your agenda - whatever agenda that may be."

The COVID-19 pandemic caused a global health crisis, a crisis which can be avoided in the future if countries choose to be prepared. Both issues come with long and diverse backgrounds of information. But if one thing is for sure, these are prominent issues that must be addressed imminently."
