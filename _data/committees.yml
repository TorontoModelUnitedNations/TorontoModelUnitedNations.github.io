  info: "TMUN 2023 will run in a hybrid format, with eight exciting in-person committees and two online
         committees. With offerings ranging from the classic Disarmament and International Security Committee to the new and innovative Mars Crisis Committee, there is a committee for everyone.
         <br><br>
         During the registration process, delegates will be able to indicate the top three committees that they would like to participate in. While we cannot guarantee that delegates will be placed in their preferred committees, it is more likely that you will receive your preferred committee if you register earlier. To see a list of countries/characters within the different committees, please check out our <a href='./matrix'>Country Matrix</a>."
