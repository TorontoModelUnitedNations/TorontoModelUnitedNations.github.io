        - title: "TOPIC A - Issues Surrounding Decolonization"
          desc: "As the age of colonialism is behind us, decolonization was and is the next step for any state that has not reached self-governance or integration with another state. As such, this can cause many issues, such as political disputes, territorial disputes, socio economic issues, and most importantly of all, affecting the livelihood of its people. The world is still very much in a grey area when it comes to decolonization, and many places’ futures are still indeterminate to this day. It is important that we come together and finally make sense of how we can properly decolonize the world and lead everyone to peace and prosperity. "
        - title: "Topic B - Refugees of the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict"
          desc: "The Israeli-Palestinian conflict has been an ongoing conflict since the mid-20th century, and has affected the lives of millions. As a result of violence and dispute, many people from the region have seen themselves displaced, living in refugee camps, where poverty is at an all time high and basic infrastructure is missing. With seemingly no conclusion to this conflict, it is imperative that the peoples’ needs are being met, in order for them to lead as healthy and prosperous lives as possible. It is important that we are able to provide the best solutions we can for these refugees, who have suffered for decades due to this issue."

      topics:
        - title: "Topic A - Mediterranean Migrant Crisis"
          desc: "The Mediterranean route is one of the popular routes used by migrants attempting to reach Europe. Migrants, typically embarking from North Africa, cross dangerous waters in hopes of landing on the shores of countries such as Spain, Italy, or Greece. These countries are often reluctant to take responsibility for any rescue and processing of migrants, and, oftentimes, the overcrowded and unsafe boats sink at sea. According to the UN, over 26,000 people have died at sea in the Mediterranean in the past decade. "
        - title: "Topic B - Governments and Social Media"
          desc: "Social media has revolutionized the manner in which information is created and shared, with far-reaching implications for governments and their citizens. From fuelling revolutions during the Arab Spring of 2011, to spreading alternative pandemic treatments and cures, the influence of social media can seriously threaten government authority and public order. On the other hand, social media has allowed billions of people to participate in democratic discourse and marginalized groups and causes to coalesce. Another concern is the vast amount of data collected by private companies and the threat to user privacy."

      topics:
        - title: "Topic A - CBRN Warfare"
          desc: "In the realm of warfare and conflict, the specter of bioweapons and chemical weapons looms ominously, underscoring the depths to which human ingenuity can descend when harnessed for destructive purposes. These two categories of unconventional weaponry, while distinct in nature, share a common thread of utilizing toxic agents to inflict harm upon adversaries. Bioweapons harness living organisms or their byproducts to unleash diseases, while chemical weapons leverage synthetic compounds to cause incapacitation or death. As the global community grapples with the evolving landscape of warfare and security threats, the responsibilities of DISEC expand beyond mere discussions to fostering tangible actions. The urgency of the situation demands that DISEC members collaborate to formulate concrete strategies that not only prevent the further spread of these devastating tools but also hold accountable those who seek to employ them. "
        - title: "Topic B - The Korean Peninsula"
          desc: "In the complex geopolitical landscape of the Korean Peninsula, the specter of nuclear mobilization has cast a shadow over regional stability and global security. The interplay of historical, political, and military dynamics has led to a situation where the presence and potential use of nuclear weaponry has become central to discussions and concerns surrounding this region. The intricate web of interests and tensions has elevated the urgency of comprehending the factors that have contributed to the nuclear mobilization in the Korean Peninsula. As one of the main committees of the United Nations General Assembly, DISEC plays a vital role in deliberating on strategies to mitigate tensions, promote disarmament, and secure a peaceful resolution to the ongoing crisis. The committee's historical significance, rooted in its establishment as a fundamental component of the UN in 1945, reflects the global acknowledgment of the imperative to prevent the escalation of nuclear tensions and promote lasting security measures."

The NKCC follows a modified version of the Crisis Rules of Procedure; during voting, the Supreme leader has full deciding power. However, outside of voting, the NKCC rules of procedure match standard crisis rules of procedure. Moreover, the NKCC includes non-North Korea figures who have historically worked closely with North Korea. This includes, among many other countries, Chinese and Macanese, and South Korean figures."

In 1989, Romania underwent a momentous shift with the downfall of Nicolae Ceaușescu's authoritarian regime. Delegates will play the roles of important figures in Romania at the time of the revolution, including leaders of the Securitate (the Security), the Party, and the revolution. This committee provides a unique opportunity for delegates to revisit a critical chapter in history when a nation's struggle for freedom and democracy reverberated across borders. Delegates will be able to collaborate to draft resolutions and policies that reflect the historical context and the aspirations of the Romanian people during this transformative era."

Confronted with immediate and enduring repercussions of radioactive contamination, delegates are faced with a weighty responsibility: determining the perils to human health and the ecosystem. Amidst the unsettling possibility of intergenerational repercussions, such as adverse genetic diseases, the delicate equilibrium between public safety, secrecy, and ethical quandaries will be navigated. Delegates are inevitably tasked with the intricate challenge of determining the next course of action within the confines of the Manhattan Project."

Spanning from negotiations at the Potsdam Conference to the anticipated onset of the Cold War, delegates will negotiate the complexities of nuclear diplomacy, arms control, and disarmament. As the test’s detonation stands not only as a scientific milestone but also the beginning of a new atomic age, delegates must consider the enduring legacy of the Trinity Test on global politics and the inexorable march of the arms race.

The International Press Corps (IPC) will function as a specialized committee that brings delegates out of debate and into writing, interviewing, and creating. Instead of the traditional Model United Nations experience, delegates will be able to interview, research, and write about happenings in other committees across TMUN. Participants will be taking on the role of various news agencies around the world instead of a specific country or individual. We invite our delegates not only to write pieces on the latest political scandals happening in real-time but also to create and distribute multimedia extensions of their journalism during the conference!

At this juncture we face a crisis where our Sun, the source of life for thousands of years, is hurtling towards a cataclysmic supernova. To confront this catastrophe the United Nations has transformed into the United Earth Government (UEG) Committee entrusted with a mission called the Moving Mountain Project. The plan entails constructing ten thousand nuclear fusion engines that can propel Earth away from the Sun's expansion, and towards a distant star system that can support life. However time becomes our adversary in this committee... Delegates become guardians of humanity's survival. Transcend roles to shape our destiny. They encounter challenges encompassing complexities, logistical hurdles and profound ethical dilemmas.
                  <br><br>
                  Resource allocation, collaboration and ethical quandaries become tests for our values and determination. The urgency demands resolute action. The fate of humanity rests upon the shoulders of those who gather together for this endeavor. Together they embark on a journey filled with obstacles and moral dilemmas—a real race, against time itself. Be part of the United Earth Government Committee where every decision and action is defined by a sense of urgency driven by this mission. This is not just a simulation; it's a race, against the clock, where the fate of humanity hangs in the balance. Our determination as a collective is crucial to ensuring our survival in the reaches of the universe. Every second matters, and there's no time for hesitation.

Delegates will be transported to the turbulent aftermath of the remilitarization of the Rhineland, a momentous event that sent reverberations throughout the international stage during the 1930s. This narrative unfolds with Germany's audacious move to remilitarize the Rhineland, brazenly flouting international treaties and marking a critical turning point in the prelude to World War II. As participants, you will find yourselves immersed in the intricate web of diplomacy and power dynamics of this era, while contending with the vital question of how the League of Nations should respond to this blatant breach of international agreements. To ensure an immersive and authentic experience, the LNHCC will adhere to a tailored set of crisis rules of procedure, meticulously designed to capture the nuances of the League's decision-making processes during this tumultuous period. Delegates will assume the roles of eminent historical figures, encompassing diplomats, heads of state, and influential personalities from around the globe, each wielding a pivotal role in shaping the course of history during this critical juncture. The destiny of nations hangs in the balance, and it falls upon the committee to chart a path forward in the wake of the Rhineland crisis."

A new world was formed, a world where the earth is completely submerged underwater. There is only one small piece of remaining land, which humanity has decided to call “Atlantis”. Most technology developed in the last few decades has sunk underwater. Food supplies are limited as agriculture has mostly died out or sunk underwater—even fish are dying out due to poisoning from nuclear wastewater, caused by the explosion of hundreds of nuclear power plants. The internet is almost completely gone, and the world as humanity knew it has ended. Worst of all, tension is brewing among the four remaining nations on Earth, and if nothing is done, it will lead to a great conflict over the scraps of what remains of the human race."
